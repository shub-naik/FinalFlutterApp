    "type": "Fungus",
    "symptoms": " The first visible symptoms of apple scab appear in the spring in the form of minute, circular, olive-green spots on leaves, often along a main vein. As they enlarge, they become brownish-black and eventually coalesce to form large patches of necrotic tissue. Affected leaves are often deformed and fall off prematurely, leading to defoliation in case of heavy infections. On shoots, the infections causes blistering and cracking that can then provide entry for opportunistic pathogens. On the fruits, brown to dark brown circular areas appear on the surface. As they develop further, they often coalesce and become raised, hard and corky. This restricts the expansion of the fruit and leads to distortion and cracking of the skin that expose the flesh. Light attacks do not affect the fruit quality significantly. However, the scabs can expose the fruits to opportunistic pathogens and rots, reducing the storage capacity and the quality. ",
    "hosts": ["Apple"],
    "trigger": " Apple scab is a disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It survives the winter mainly on infected leaves on the ground but also on bud scales or lesions on wood. At the onset of spring, the fungus resumes growth and starts to produce spores, which are later discharged and dispersed over long distances by the wind. These spores land on developing leaves and fruits and start a new infection. Outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to scab. However, as the fruit matures it becomes much less susceptible. Humid environment, wetting period of leaves or fruits are essential for the infection. Alternative hosts include shrubs of the genus Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Sorbus. All apple varieties are susceptible to scab, with Gala being more vulnerable. ",
    "biaological_control": " If disease levels were high the previous season, liquid copper fungicides can be sprayed to impede the fungal growth on the tree during the winter season. Sulfur sprays are only partially effective against apple scab. However, solutions containing sulfur and pyrethrins are available for organic control of the disease during the growing season. ",
    "chemical_control": " Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Protectant fungicides such as dodine, captan or dinathion can be sprayed around bud break to avoid the disease. Once scab has been detected, fungicides based on difenoconazole, myclobutanil or sulphur can be used to control the development of the fungus. Ensure scab fungicides from different chemical groups are used to avoid the development of resistance. ",

Over time, as the spots enlarge, the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely, leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms.

Feeding damage can be observed on green stems, leaves, and fruits. The mites live and inject saliva on both leaf surface and on fruit skin, causing the epidermal skin cells to disintegrate. The upper cuticle looses its glossy nature, and becomes dull and bronze-like or show yellow patches in areas of russeting. Initially, lower leaf surfaces appear as pale patches, and later as necrotic spots. The feeding destroys the rind cells and the surface becomes silvery on lemons, rust brown on mature oranges, and black on green oranges. This is called \"russeting\" when rust mite injury happened early in the season and \"bronzing\" when mature fruits are injured. The injured surface is smooth and dark brown in color, and the blemishes become more severe if they hang on the tree longer. Infested fruit appears smaller when injured before fruit maturity. A heavy infestation can cause severe damage in young trees. When Citrus Rust Mite feeds on fruit during the early spring season, the peel turns rough in texture with a lighter color than during summer. This is referred to as sharkskin. ",

It is obvious only when present in large numbers on the fruit or leaf surface. It gives the appearance of powder dust. White, spherical eggs are laid in small groups on the surface of the leaves or fruits. The egg is then followed by two active nymph stages before turning into an adult mite. One generation of mites can be completed in six days at 30\u00b0C. Females live for four to six weeks laying 30 eggs in a lifetime. The frequent presence of isolated blemished fruit is the first sign of Rust Mite infestation in an orchard. When this is noted during a particular season, it must be regarded as a serious Rust Mite warning for the following season.

Over time, these areas give the fruits a characteristic rusty aspect, with deep red to dark brown colored skin. Usually, only the peel shows damage, but if infestation is heavy the whole fruit can show signs of damage. On more mature fruits, cracks may be visible. Sometimes the fruits split open. The infestation is most harmful to fruit bunches when infested in early development stages. ",

Older leaves usually show purple spots (3-6 mm in diameter) on the upper surface, sometimes with a slightly darker halo. In some cases, as the spots mature, they become white to gray and grow surrounded by a brownish halo. Atypical lesions, uniformly brown without darker borders or lighter centers, may form in warm humid weather on young leaves. Later on, the whole leaf is covered by numerous lesions and become chlorotic, withered and die. New, young foliage is actually more susceptible to the pathogen. Elongated lesions may form on petioles and stolons, interfering with water transport and making the plant more susceptible to invasion by a secondary organism. ",

During the spring, they resume growth and start to produce spores that are spread to the lower leaves of the neighboring plants. Spores that land onto the leaf lamina form germ tubes which penetrate through natural openings on upper and lower surfaces of leaves. As it grows, the fungus produces clusters of new spores that are carried to new leaves by rain splashes and wind. Human or machinery activity in the field can also be a source of contamination. The fruits are generally not directly affected, but the loss of foliage can reduce their quality and the yield. Disease development is favored by cool daytime temperatures (around 25 \u00b0C) and cold nighttime temperatures, high relative humidity, and prolonged leaf wetness. Bad cultural practices, such as short spacing between plants, can also increases the risk of infection. ",

A prolonged exposure of almond trees to high populations of poplar lace bugs may cause premature leaf drop (or defoliation) and a reduction in plant growth. The symptoms caused by this pest are not unique. Certain other true bugs and thrips also produce leaf stippling and dark excrement. Mite infestations do show stippling but not dark excrement, and rather display mite cast skins and fine silken webbing.

With the arrival of the spring they emerge and recover their activity, settling on the leaves. Female insert tiny, oblong eggs, in isolation or in groups, close to the main veins on the underside of leaves and cover them with dark excrement. Nymphs appear at 10-18 days, forming colonies and feeding gregariously by piercing and sucking the leaf sap. They reach adulthood after about 10 days, passing through five nymphal states.

Slightly raised, pale orange to yellowish brown blisters can be observed underneath these spots on the lower leaf surface. Later the symptoms on both sides become darker brown or black and take a more 'greasy' appearance. Affected trees may gradually loose their leaves, reducing tree vigor and fruit yield. On fruits, greasy spot is characterized by the appearance of small, necrotic black specks  surrounded by a green area, a symptom called greasy spot rind blotch. These can cover a large portion of the surface of the fruit. In areas with high temperature and high rainfall the infection may occur at any time. ",

    "trigger": " The symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella citri, which survives in crop debris on the soil surface when no suitable crop is available. In the spring, when conditions are favorable, the fungus produces spores that are released by rain splashes, overhead irrigation or heavy dew. Wind can also transport them to other citrus groves. Once they land onto the lower side of a leaf, they germinate and the fungi slowly penetrate the tissues through the natural pores on the blade. This process is also favored by elevated temperatures, high humidity and prolonged leaf moisture. Several months can pass between the primary infection during the summer and the appearance of the first symptoms in winter. By contrast, cool temperatures and dry weather result in lower spore number and less infection. Leaves remain susceptible to infection throughout the growth stages of the tree if environmental conditions are favorable.

In the latter, it is usually characterized by holes at the stem end, at the contact zone between two fruits or where leaves touch the fruit. The larvae  feed , boring shallow tunnels and surface grooves. In high population numbers,  they can cause extensive damage to young trees or nursery stock.

Females lay eggs on young shoots, fruit, and on the underside of leaves, next to the vein. Larvae are small and have a brown body with alternating white rings and a black head. They overwinter in shelters under the bark, crevices on old wood or in pruning wounds. During the bloom period they come to light again and migrate to twigs and branches, where they attack newly emerged leaves, blossoms and shoots. They burrow down the tender shoots, blocking the transport of water and nutrients, and causing them to wilt and die. They can also cause the destruction of the growing points in older shoots, causing the dieback of the branch and in some occasion lateral branching.

Ants also happen to feed on the larvae. These natural enemies can reduce significantly the population of larvae, but often not below economically damaging levels. Therefore, timely applications of organically-approved oils, pyrethrin, spinosad or insecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to supplement these treatments.

Later on, the development of necrotic areas in the highly chlorotic tissue gives the leaves a rugged and deformed aspect. Finally, the yellowing engulfs the whole leaf, eventually leading to premature death and early shedding. Root growth is inhibited, resulting in poor plant vigor. ",

    "symptoms": " The damage from the banana scab moths is primarily caused by the larval stage and principally confined to the fruits. The larvae concentrate their attack on fruit bunches still protected by bracts. At emergence, they start feeding on the inflorescences and the surface of the developing fruits, damaging them superficially and resulting in scars which quickly turn black. Over time, as the bract begin to lift and fall, they migrate down the bunch to younger and still shielded fruits. If they have no alternative, the larvae remain at the base of the bunch, feeding on male inflorescences, or on maturing fruits. Often a clear jelly-like substance, which appears to be associated only with banana scab moth feeding, is present at these sites. The cosmetic scabbing of the fruit cause makes them unsuitable for market. ",
    "hosts": ["Banana"],
    "trigger": " The damage is caused by the banana scab moth, Nacoleia octasema. Adults are light brown of yellowish-brown with black marks on wings. These short-lived moth (4-5 days)  have twilight-active habits and mates in the early evening. During the day, they hide in trash and under old leaf axils. Females lay eggs on the emerging bunches or the surrounding leaves and bracts. After hatching, the larvae make their way to the bunch and commence feeding. The life cycle from egg-hatching to egg-laying is completed in 28 days. The banana scab moth favors moist and warm conditions, causing the worst damage during the wet season. The cooler and drier winter months are usually free of this insect, unless unseasonal rainfall occurs during this period. Research has shown adults do not mate and lay eggs under low humidity and dry conditions. It is one of the most economically damaging pests in banana and can cause up to 100% bunch damage if left uncontrolled. ",
    "biaological_control": " No major parasite or predator have been identified against this pest. Some wasp parasites, spiders and other general predators provide a low level of natural control. The ant Tetramorium bicarinatum which is commonly found on plants and bunches can give some control of the banana scab moth.

As fruit grow, the damaged rind extends outward from beneath the sepals and becomes a conspicuous ring of scarred tissue. Fruit are most susceptible to damage from shortly after petal fall until they are about 3.7 cm in diameter. The risk of attack by thrips is higher on the fruits located on the outside of the canopy, where they are also susceptible to wind damage and sunburn.

These eggs will hatch in the next spring about the time of the new growth in the trees. Young larvae are very small, whereas older ones are about the size of adults, spindle-shaped, and wingless. Last larval stages (pupa) thrips do not feed and complete their development on the ground or in the crevices of trees. When adults emerge, they move actively around the tree foliage.

The center of the spots can dry up and fall out, conferring a shot-hole appearance to the lesion. Severely infected leaves become distorted, brittle and can fall off prematurely. On petioles and shoots, brown to black spots take an elongated shape or develop into streaks. They often coalesce and form dark blotches that can girdle or split the tissues, resulting in deformation or death of shoots. Later in the season, rachis (peduncles) and berries can also show symptoms. The fruits turn brown and leathery (mummification), with black specks on the surface. Infected rachises wither, causing berries or entire clusters to drop prematurely. \r\n ",

    "symptoms": " Symptoms vary slightly depending on the species of tree affected. In early summer, round purple to brownish blurred spots appear on the upper side of older leaves. The spots are typically 1-3mm in diameter and turn reddish brown over time. At later stages of the disease, the spots gradually merge to form larger lesions that can cover a large portion of the lamina. In some hosts, the necrotic part of the leaf lesion falls out, resulting in a shot-hole effect. On the lower side of leaves small red to white spots, mainly bound to the leaf veins, can be observed. Over time, they develop into yellowish or white spore cushions that are visible to the naked eye. Leaves will turn entirely yellow and can shed prematurely. Severe infections can lead to a total defoliation by midsummer, with the consequent effect on the development of fruits, which can become soft and immature, or ripen unevenly. ",

In spring, when temperatures are above 6\u00b0C, the fungus germinates and produces spores that are spread by wind or rain. Leaves remain susceptible throughout the growing season. The infection cycle can be repeated several times during a single season, depending on environmental conditions, particularly leaf wetness. For example, at temperatures below 10\u00b0C and above 30 \u00b0C, the fungus needs 28 hours of leaf wetness for a successful infection. The corresponding time interval at temperatures around 20\u00b0C  is 5 hours. This explains why serious damage usually occurs in years with numerous rainy periods throughout late spring and summer. Trees become more susceptible to stress (for example frost), and blossom and leaf production may be reduced for at least the two subsequent years. ",

Two types of lesions are visible on older leaves: in mild cases, black specks and large eye-shaped lesions with light gray centers and darker margins. Severely infected leaves, in turn, are characterized by the presence of black specks and small brown spots with black margin and sometimes a chlorotic halo.

Additionally, leaf veins become swollen with shortening of internodes and petioles. Older leaves become leathery and brittle. If plants are infected during the early season, their growth will be stunted, resulting in significant yield reduction. Fruit formation in susceptible cultivars is rudimentary and distorted. The virus causes similar symptoms as the feeding damage of thrips and mites. ",

They are characterized as 1.5 mm long, waxy white wings with a pale yellow body and are frequently found on the lower side of the leaves. The spread of the disease depends on the wind condition, which will indicate how far the whiteflies can travel. Whiteflies are most problematic in the mid-to-late season. Since the disease is not seed-borne, the virus persists in the landscape via alternative hosts (such as tobacco and tomato) and weeds. Some additional factors that can favor the development of the disease are recent rainfall, infected transplants, and the presence of weeds.

Under favorable conditions, it starts to produce spores that may be transported by air currents over long distances. It is also thought that its spread could be facilitated by some species of midges. The susceptibility of cereals to this fungus is at its highest around the flowering period. Once it germinates on the plant tissue, it is able to penetrate the cuticle directly through natural pores. As it grows in the vascular tissues, it hinders the supply of water and nutrients in the spikes, resulting in the typically bleached spikelets and the shriveled kernels. Moreover, the production of toxins reduces the marketability of the grain.

They fail to hatch when kept at temperatures below 4\u00b0C for long periods. Larvae have dark brown heads and light-brown to pink bodies. They bore into petioles, young shoots or leaf veins and later into the tubers, making irregular galleries. 25\u00b0C is the optimum temperature for their life cycle but tolerance ranges between 15 and 40\u00b0C. Cracks in dry soils favor the survival of the larvae. ",

    "name": " Woolly Aphid ",
    "scientific_name": " Eriosoma lanigerum ",
    "type": "Insect",
    "symptoms": " White hairy insects can be seen feeding on buds, twigs, branches, shoots and even on the roots. Distorted leaves, yellowing foliage, poor growth and branch dieback are the consequence of this activity. A white, fluffy covering and honeydew appear near the feeding sites. On bark and shoots, the development of cankers and swellings is also characteristic. Underground forms of the aphid also attack roots and lead to the formation of swollen enlargements or large knots. The impaired transport of water and nutrients explains the yellowish appearance of the trees. These galls increase in size from year to year as a result of aphid feeding. The wounds caused by the insects and the presence of the honeydew also attract opportunistic fungi that may cover the infected tissues with sooty mold. Young plants are easily uprooted when infested. ",
    "hosts": ["Apple", "Pear", "Sugarcane"],
    "trigger": " The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the woolly aphid Eriosoma lanigerum. Unlike most aphids, it sucks sap from the woody stems and shoots, rather than from foliage. This insect is characterized by its white, thick, fluffy wax covering. It overwinters on its host in cracks on the bark or on suberised wounds around old feeding sites. As temperatures increase in the spring, the aphids become active again and climb on the suckers,  younger shoots and branches in search of a vulnerable sites (areas with thinner bark). There, it feeds gregariously, sucking sap from beneath the bark, and starts secreting the fluffy hairs that eventually wrapped the colony. Opportunistic pathogen can then colonize these open wounds. During the summer, the adults grow wings and fly off in search of new host plants. Elm trees in the vicinity of orchards increase the migration of the aphid to apple orchards. ",
    "biaological_control": " Spray solutions must be able to penetrate the woolly coat secreted by the aphids to kill them. Diluted alcohol solutions or insecticidal soaps can be splashed over the woolly spots to disturb them. Ecological oils or neem abstracts (2-3 ml/l water) can also be sprayed over the trees. Good coverage and a follow-up spray 7 days after first application are essential. Parasites or predators such as lacewings, ladybugs (Exochomus quadripustulatus), hoverflies larvae, and parasitic wasps (Aphelinus mali) can help to control populations. Artificial refuges foster populations of predator earwigs, for example Forficula auricularia. ",
    "chemical_control": " Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical controls can be applied either preventively or after detection. Systemic treatments can be useful to deter the aphids from feeding on treated plants. Unfortunately they can also be harmful to beneficial insects. Reactive sprays include formulations based on deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and acetamiprid. Carbamates and pyrethroids should be avoided as they encourage outbreaks of aphids by killing parasites and predators. Trees in flower should not be sprayed due to the danger to pollinating insects. ",
    "preventive_measures": [
      " Choose resistant varieties if available. ",
      " In mild infestations, the insect can be monitored and scrubbed with a brush. ",
      " Apply fortifiers or balanced fertilization to strengthen the plants. ",
      " Avoid the excessive usage of pesticides as they can decrease populations of beneficial insects. ",
      " Summer prune in late summer to remove developing colonies. ",
      " Remove affected young shoots and branches. ",
      " Remove suckers at the base of the plant to create less favorable conditions for the aphids. ",
      " Paint large pruning cuts with commercial pruning paint to discourage aphid colonies. ",
      " Do not plant elm trees close to apple tree orchards. "

    "symptoms": " At first, yellow spots appear on the upper side of leaves. At later stage of the disease, a whitish, later greyish, floury covering spreads on leaves, stalks and fruits. The fungus extracts nutrients from the plant and the ash-like layer on the leaves hinders photosynthesis, resulting in stunted plant growth. As the disease progresses, infected parts shrivel, leaves fall off and plants might die. As opposed to Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew can be controlled to some extent. ",
